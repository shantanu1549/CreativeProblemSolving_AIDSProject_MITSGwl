# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete **machine learning pipeline** for predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.  
It involves **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment** through an **interactive Streamlit web app**.  

The goal is to showcase the power of **data-driven predictive modeling** for health analytics and demonstrate how such models can be deployed for real-time user interaction.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection** — Load the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** — Handle missing values, normalize data, and split train-test sets.  
3. **Model Training** — Train ML models such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest.  
4. **Model Evaluation** — Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
5. **Model Deployment** — Deploy interactive web interface using Streamlit.
